      <h2><u>Why is online safety important</u></h2>
      <p>
        Between 2023 and 2024, Cyber attacks across the globe has seen an
        increase by around 30%. The losses made from cyber crime are expected to
        hit 24 trillion dollars by 2027, if cyber crime continues to
        exponentially increase at the rate it currently is. It can be extremely
        harmful

      <h3><u>Protection of Personal information</u></h3>
      <p>
        Additionally, because we live more of our lives through our screens the
        more personal details and information we keep on the digital landscape.
        This places us into an increasing level of risk when this information
        ends up in the wrong hands. For example information such as: personal
        communications, financial transactions, health records and past social
        media posts are all components of what is known as your digital
        footprint. All of this information can be traced back to you and can be
        utilised in many ways, sometimes malicously.
      </p>

    <div id="heading_3">
      <h3><u>Protection of children</u></h3>
      <p>
        Children are the most vunerable group of internet users due to them
        being unable to recognise potential risks. This maeks them targets for
        cybercriminals and online theats. Around 25% of 5-7 year olds have a
        smart phone, and 76% of them will use a tablet. 32% of parents have also
        stated that they would let there child use social media entirely on
        their own. These statistics are taken from studies conducted between
        2017 to present day.
        <br />
        Furthermore, with the rise of social media, there has been an increase
        in cyberbullying and online harrassment. 73% of young women have
        recieved unwanted sexual content online. 26.5% of American teenagers
        have experienced cyberbullying within the last 30 days. These statistics
        clearly indicate that online crime is a hugely widespread problem and
        steps should be taken to try and protect people online.

      <h3><u>Social Engineering</u></h3>
      <p>
        Social engineering in the context of cyber security is the process of
        maniupulating and deceiving someone into giving sensitive information or
        control over a computer system. Social engineering is done entirely in
        person and therefore relies on human interaction and psycology to work,
        it cannot be defended against using software. Therefore it is vital
        people can understand what social engineering is and how harmful it can
        be.
        <br />
        <br />
        98% of cyber attacks will involve some sort of social engieering 75% of
        companies have reported being a victim of a socially engineered attack
        in the year 2020.

      <h2><u>Practices for staying safe online</u></h2>
    </div>

    <div id="heading_3">
      <h3><u>Securing Connections</u></h3>
      <p>
        1. Only connect to internet connections you know are secure. Especially
        when handling sensitive information. You can tell if a webpage is secure
        if it has HTTPS in the URL.
        <br />
        Some good practices to use when connecting to networks you are not
        familiar with is using a VPN (virtual private network) for added
        security via encryption.
        <br />
        <br />
        2. Disabling bluetooth on devices with very private information can
        prevent hacking. However this is most likely overkill however it is
        something to keep in mind
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="heading_3">
      <h3><u>Protecting Devices and Accounts</u></h3>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Secure passwords</h4>
      1. One of the best ways to ensure that your devices and accounts are
      secure from outside attack is to use secure unique passwords for
      everything. If your the forgetful type, a password manager can be
      extremely useful for keeping track and making sure you dont forget. A
      great resource to check if your password is secure is to use
      <a href="https://www.passwordmonster.com/"
        >https://www.passwordmonster.com/</a
      >
      <br />
      <h4>Keeping software updated</h4>
      2. Additionally, all software should be updated to the latest possible
      version. This is because software engineer will include security
      enhancements and patches to bugs that hackers may attempt to exploit. This
      greatly reduces the chance that your device or account will be a target.
      <br />
      <br />
      <h4>Encryption</h4>
      3. Using only fully encrypted communication channels, especially when
      exchaning private or sensitive information is extremely important.
      Encryption is the process of protecting data by scrambling and altering
      that data into a format that is unreadable by humans. This is done using
      whats known as keys. Keys are essentially the algorithm that is resonsible
      for scrambling the data, therefore the data can only be read by individual
      who possess the encryption key. This means that outside hackers who may
      attempt to intercept your message that you are sending cannot physically
      read it as its simply a bunch of jumbled up nonsense. For this reason I
      highly suggest double checking messaging services or websites where
      sensitive data is being exhanged to make sure that it is encrypted. You
      can again check this by ensuring that the URL contains HTTPS.
